                    <h2>1. INTRODUCTION AND SERVICES PROVIDED</h2>
                    <ul class="c">
                        <li>The Restaurants uses the Application to digitize its menu (the Menu) by registering and uploading their menu in its Restaurant account and automates the order taking process at their existing locations by generating location specific QR codes and using the QR4Order.com POS app (the POS App) which is an integral part of the Application. The Diner uses the QR code affixed in the Restaurant or a link provided by the Restaurant to place an Order which is transmitted directly to the Restaurant in real time. The payment can be made by the Diner directly to the Restaurant. The Application is thus an automation solution whereby the Diner is able to order items from the Restaurant’s menu (digitized using the Application) and the ordered items are displayed in the Restaurant’s account in the POS app for the Restaurant to approve or disapprove respectively. The operation of the Restaurant otherwise is not affected in any way by the use of the Application by the Restaurant or the Diner. 
</li>
                        <li>Initially, the Restaurant first has to register with the Developer to create their account in the Developer’s Application. The Restaurant will accept the ‘Terms and Conditions” (TnC) incorporated in the Application while registering. Upon registration, the Restaurant Account owner can login to set up one or more locations in their Restaurant Account. The Restaurant account holder can then add tables (locations) with unique QR codes for each table or location.  </li>
                        <li>The Restaurant can then create a menu. The Application provides many tools for the Restaurant to create its menu. The online menu of each Restaurant will be made available to the Diner through a QR code generated for each table or location that is placed at the location where the Diner can scan and order using their own smartphone. The Diner can also use the link provided by the Restaurant to access the same functionality. 
</li>
                        <li> To use the Services, the Diner should scan the QR code provided by the Restaurant at its location and get directed to the Developer’s browser based Web Application (the Web App). Now, the Application will allow the Diner to access an online menu corresponding to that location as created and updated by the Restaurant. The Diner will at this point accepts the Terms and Conditions (TnC) incorporated in the Web App before accessing it.
</li>
                        <li>Once the Order is placed by the Diner, the Order details will be seen on the POS App (part of the Developer’s Application) associated to that QR code. The Restaurant’s employee (the Waiter) will be notified via the POS App of all Orders received from the various Diners. The Waiter then approves the Order which then is transmitted to the Kitchen. The Restaurant serves the Diner the ordered items as per the standard operating procedure of the Restaurant. The Diner can make the payment directly to the Restaurant for the Order placed. In this case the Developer is not involved in the transaction. In this case, the Developer is merely providing a free service to the Restaurant and the Diner whereby the Restaurant’s menu is displayed to the Diner and the Diner uses the Application developed by the Developer to place an Order at the Restaurant that is fulfilled directly by the Restaurant. No money is exchanged via the Developer’s Application in this case.
</li>
                        <li> When the Developer’s Payment Gateway is available at a given location, the Diner may opt for making the payment using the Developer’s Payment Gateway to expedite and streamline the payment procedure. In this case, the Developer will collect the transaction amount from the Diner on behalf of the Restaurant and then remit the balance, after deducting charges and service fees, to the Restaurant as per Schedule 1.
</li>
                        <li>By scanning the QR code at the Restaurant The Diner can select desired menu items from the menu, one at a time, from the Restaurant's menu. A Checkout Screen, containing the selected menu items and the total purchase price comprised of the subtotal, service fees and sales tax will be presented to the Diner for review. (the "Checkout Screen"). To proceed with the order, the Diner will click "Submit" on the Checkout Screen and the total purchase price will be deducted from the Diner's account balance if he/she opts for the Developer's payment gateway to make online payment to the Restaurant. Once the order is submitted, the Diner will receive a digital receipt confirming the name, address, and phone number of the Restaurant, the Diner's order (with a unique order number) and the total bill amount. The digital receipt will be sent to the Diner's email account and will also be displayed in the Application open in the browser of the Diner's smartphone. 
</li>
                        <li>If an order cannot be processed for whatever reason, for example because of the unavailability of the ordered item, the Waiter has to cancel the order in the POS and notify the Diner in person that the order was unsuccessful and was canceled. In the event of an unsuccessful order, the Diner's account will not be charged and the services will not be provided. In this case the Diner can opt to re-scan the QR code and place a new order or call the Restaurant's Waiter for further assistance.</li>
